# pixels - Yet another SVG editor

Browser based SVG editor to make pixel-like svg images.

I use this project for experiments with new libraries and technologies.

If you too lazy to build this, but want to see how it works - feel free to ask me to show.

## Main ideas:

- edit svg as pixels. Like small ico files
- save result as svg, png or matrix format
- customize palette
- live preview in different sizes

## TODO

### Tech
- add editor config
- add gulp dev:watch mode
- use semantic UI
- choose autodoc system and add comments to the code
- rewrite js with new ECMA2105 cool features
- add uglify
- add some MVVM

### Soul
- save current state to local storage
- upload/download as matrix & png
- customize palette
- add some design
- create logo with Pixels
- social elements (publish result to the site, twitter, etc)
- like feature
