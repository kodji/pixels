# pixels - Yet another SVG editor

Browser based SVG editor to make pixel-like svg imagesSimple svg editor.

I use this project for experiments with new libraries and technologies

## Main ideas:

- edit svg as pixels. Like small ico files
- save result as svg, png or matrix format
- customize palette
- live preview in different sizes

## TODO

- build jade with gulp
- build sass with gulp
- add editor config
- use semantic UI
- choose autodoc system and add comments to the code
- rewrite code with babel
- make base with angular
- create logo with Pixels
- add social elements (publish result to the site, twitter, etc)
