# pixels - Yet another SVG editor

Browser based SVG editor to make pixel-like svg images.

I use this project for experiments with libraries and technologies.

If you too lazy to build this, but want to see how it works - feel free to ask me to show.

## Main ideas:

- edit svg as pixels. Like small ico files
- save result as svg, png or matrix format
- customize palette
- live preview in different sizes
- make comics and share it

## DONE

- make build system with gulp
- use snap.svg
- create pixel like svg editor
- download as SVG
- create palette and change pencil color with click
- use babel
- use new ECMA2015 class definition
- use semantic UI
- create logo with Pixels

## Working Now

- add some design
- divide templates to partials and mixins and make more pages
- create cool and simple main menu
- create clever footer

## TODO

### Tech
- add editor config
- add cp media task to gulp
- add gulp dev:watch mode
- choose autodoc system and add comments to the code
- rewrite js with new ECMA2105 cool features
- add uglify
- add some MVVM

### Soul
- save current state to local storage
- add upload/download as matrix & png
- add customize palette feature
- add share feature - twitter, fb, vk, embedded
- multiple cards - like comics
- like feature
- comments feature
